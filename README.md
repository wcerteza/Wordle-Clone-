#### This is a clone of the popular game Wordle. Wordle is a word game that involves figuring out a secret five-letter word. You play by guessing different five-letter words to see how close they are to the secret word. When you submit a guess, the game will tell you how close your guess is by color-coding each letter in your guess.
